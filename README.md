# Number Guessing
Simple simulation to show you can guess a number from 1 to 1000 using only 10 guesses (not 11). This is because each guess actually provides more than a bit of information about the numberâ€“you know whether your guess was too high or too low, but you also know whether the guess was correct or not.
